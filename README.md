A product of LA Hacks 2016. After having our meetups repeatedly delayed due to late people, we thought we'd build a tool to help plan our get-togethers while also displaying the ETA status of our not-so-punctual friend group.

## Description
It's nice to know exactly how late your friends are going to be, right? Think of what you can do with all the time in between: purchase a drink from Tea Era, consume a drink from Tea Era, purchase another drink from Tea Era... the possibilities are endless. 

Floxx is the Android app that will give you this information. Cohesively, it's a meetup facilitator; it allows users to 

- add friends,
- create groups to hang out with,
- select a place on the map to meet,
- and then view constantly changing ETA descriptions for everyone else.

(Generally in that order.) Its vast array of features also includes a Tea Era button, the ability to toggle location services, and personalization for map markers.

## Installation
You can install Floxx by downloading our APK [here](app/app-debug.apk?raw=true) (note that this is currently a debug build).

## Usage
To do anything really, you'll first need to create an in-app account. Once you've done that, you're free to explore the wonderful world of Floxx.

#### Adding friends
To begin with, everyone has at least one friend â€“ Oski the bear.

#### Using the map
The map will load with a center at your position. On the map, you will be distinguished by a blue marker. Everyone else will manifest themselves as red markers. To place a meeting point, simply tap on the map. Note that you can always drag the meeting marker around later (ETA and distance information will automatically update when you do this).

#### Turning off location services
Once you're signed in, just click the little gear at the bottom of the screen. That should launch the Settings page, where you should see a button to "Toggle location services."
