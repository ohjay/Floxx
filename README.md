A product of LA Hacks 2016. After having our meetups repeatedly delayed due to late people, we thought we'd build a tool to help plan our get-togethers while also displaying the ETA status of our not-so-punctual friend group.

## Description
It's nice to know exactly how late your friends are going to be, right? Think of what you can do with all the time in between: purchase a drink from Tea Era, consume a drink from Tea Era, purchase another drink from Tea Era... the possibilities are endless.

Floxx is the Android app that will give you this information. Cohesively, it's a meetup facilitator; it allows users to

- add friends,
- create groups to hang out with,
- select a place on the map to meet,
- and then view constantly changing ETA descriptions for everyone else.

(Generally in that order.) Its vast array of features also includes a Tea Era button, the ability to toggle location services, and personalization for map markers.

## Installation
You can install Floxx by loading the signed APK below. When the link is clicked, your system should automatically start downloading the file. Since you'll need to get the APK onto your Android phone, either open the link from a mobile web browser or save it on your computer and then transfer it from there. Once you've got the file, launch it – probably via some file management app – and follow the instructions.

## Usage
To do anything really, you'll first need to create an in-app account. Once you've done that, you're free to explore the wonderful world of Floxx.

There are eight different screens that you might see while exploring Floxx. Ordered by chronological appearance, they are the **splash screen (SPL)**, the **registration screen (REG)**, the **confirmation screen (CNF)**, the **user portal (UPO)**, the **friend management page (FRI)**, the **group creation screen (GRP)**, the **meetup portal (MEE)**, and the **map (MAP)**.

#### Adding friends
To begin with, everyone has at least one friend – Oski the bear. And since you probably don't have any in real life (come on, why else would you be using Floxx), we've made it easy for you to add more. From the user portal, click the "manage friends" button; this should load the FRI page. Go down to the "add friends" section, click the search icon, and type in your query. The top five results will be displayed – you can send friend requests to any of them via the buttons next to their names.

Once this has happened, you'll have to wait for the other party to accept (or not accept) your request. This will happen on the FRI page as well, where your request will be displayed under "pending friend requests."

#### Using the map
The map will load with a center at your position. On the map, you will be distinguished by a blue marker (by default; if you selected a different color during customization it will be used instead). Everyone else will manifest themselves as burgundy markers (again by default; customization will change this).

To place a meeting point, simply tap on the map. Whenever the meeting marker is placed or moved, the info bar at the bottom of the screen should update with the overall meetup ETA, and everyone's marker snippets will display individual ETAs and distance information. You will have to click on specific markers if you want to view these.

Note that you can always drag the meeting marker around (by performing a long press and then moving your finger around). ETA and distance information will automatically update when you do this.

#### Turning off location services
Your privacy is very important to us. As long as location updates are turned off, no one else will be able to view your current location. (On the map, you'll be displayed as a hidden user.)

To deactivate (or restore) location updates, first sign in. On the user portal, you'll see a "toggle location services" button, which you should click. This will launch a dialog, from which you can view your current status and set location updates to be either "on" or "off."

## Bugs...?
Look, it's not a bug. It's a feature. But in all seriousness, we at Floxx are perfectionists. Please let us know exactly how and why our app sucks, so that our main developer can get mad at you and fix the problem. Said developer has created a Google form for such an occasion, and you can find that [at this link](http://goo.gl/forms/OyjZhH97Cf3dy8gx2). If you have a GitHub account and know your way around, we'd love for you to file a ticket on here as well.

As an incentive (/thank-you) for helping us out, we'll send you a picture of Richard in a rabbit costume every time you submit a quality bug report. Surely that will get you going! :)
