TODO (ESSENTIAL)
----------------
1. Allow users to search for and request friends, then only show THOSE people on the group creation page. [4 hrs]
2. Set up background location check. Alternatively, factor in time (when the locn was noted) and extrapolate. [6 hrs]
3. Enable users to turn off location services. [3 hrs]
4. Improve the authentication flow; have users enter email during registration. Also fix error messages (e.g. when a username is taken). [4 hrs]
5. Make users stay logged in. Allow them to sign out, too. [3 hrs]
6. Fix the app UI/layout...! [14 hrs]
7. Let people personalize their map markers (e.g. color). [4 hrs]
8. Add password confirmation to registration. [1 hr]
9. Test and debug; have people try out the app and attempt to break it. [6 hrs]

// Total: 45 hrs
* Time estimates = (Owen's original call) x 2

----------------------------
TODO (MINOR and/or OPTIONAL)
----------------------------
1. Let users specify their mode of transportation.
2. Log users' location/hangout history somewhere and allow them to view it.
3. Authentication integration with Facebook.
4. If authentication with Facebook, add profile pictures to map markers.
5. Put some kind of instructions somewhere, or add an "About" page.
6. Upon startup, have map zoom in at an appropriate level (scaled to minimally fit all of the people in the group).
