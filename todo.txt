1. Allow users to search for and request friends, then only show those people on the Friends page.
2. Set up background location check. Alternatively, factor in time (when the locn was noted) and extrapolate.
3. Enable users to turn off location services.
4. Improve the authentication flow; either enter email during registration or login with FB. Also fix error messages (e.g. when a username is taken).
5. Make users stay logged in. Allow them to sign out, too.
6. Fix the app UI/layout...!
7. Add face icons to other people's map markers.
