TODO (ESSENTIAL)
----------------
1. Send email confirmations during registration. [2 hrs] /RICHARD
2. Fix the app UI/layout...! [12 hrs]

// Total: 14 hrs
* Time estimates = (Owen's original call) x 2
* Reminder: also look @ the TODOs scattered across our codebase

----------------------------
TODO (MINOR and/or OPTIONAL)
----------------------------
1. Let users specify their mode of transportation.
2. Upon startup, have map zoom in at an appropriate level (scaled to minimally fit all of the people in the group).
3. Add a "move marker" button to the map overlay that allows only one user to move the meeting marker at a time (this should prevent weird jumpy meeting points).

-------------------------
TODO (BUG REPORTS / EASY)
-------------------------
1. Somehow I got TWO fullscreen activities by hitting the back button a lot. Look into this.
2. Get rid of the double requests page (since the searchable thingy seems to create a new view).
3. The search view says "...please stand by..." for some reason.
4. Gray out (/disallow) already-requested friends on Requests page.

---------------------
LAYOUTS/UX TO UPGRADE
---------------------
1. Requests interface (6/23)
2. Group creation interface (6/24)
3. Meetup portal interface (6/24)
4. Map interface (incl. bottom layer) (6/25)
5. Portrait/landscape transition for each page (/restrict to portrait?) (6/25)
