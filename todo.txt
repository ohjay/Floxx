TODO (BUG REPORTS / MINOR)
--------------------------
1. Bug report: crash when creating a group and running the map for the first time (after confirming that you'll allow Floxx to "access this device's location").
2. Look at the TODOs scattered across our codebase.
3. Look through (/clean up) all code. For example, turn standard output into logs.
