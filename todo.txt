TODO (BUG REPORTS / MINOR)
--------------------------
1. Bug report: crash when creating a group and running the map for the first time (after confirming that you'll allow Floxx to "access this device's location").
2. Bug report: "user is already in a meetup" just because some other person INVITED him to her meetup (?).
3. Look at the TODOs scattered across our codebase.
4. Look through (/clean up) all code. For example, turn standard output into logs.
5. Fill in the README.
