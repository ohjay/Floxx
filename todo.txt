1. Bug report: crash when creating a group and running the map for the first time (after confirming that you'll allow Floxx to "access this device's location").
2. Look at the TODOs in MapActivity.
3. Look through (/clean up) all code. For example, turn standard output into logs.
4. Fill in the README.
