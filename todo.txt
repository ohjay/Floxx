TODO (BUG REPORTS / MINOR)
--------------------------
1. Bug report: somehow I got TWO fullscreen activities by hitting the back button a lot.
2. Bug report: crash when creating a group and running the map for the first time (after confirming that you'll allow Floxx to "access this device's location").
3. Look at the TODOs scattered across our codebase.
4. Fix meetup IDs... make them actually unique. (Right now, they're indistinguishable if started by the same user on the same day.)
