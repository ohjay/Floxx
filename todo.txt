--------------------------
TODO (BUG REPORTS / MINOR)
--------------------------
1. Look at the TODOs in MapActivity.
2. Look through (/clean up) all code. For example, turn standard output into logs.
3. Bug report: when you open the map, it starts in Africa.
4. Bug report: Location services don't seem to be able to connect sometimes. Doesn't find a location for YOU, and doesn't show ETA/distance info for others (people who were already in the meetup) either.
