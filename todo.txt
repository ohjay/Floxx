// Total: 10 hrs

TODO (BUG REPORTS / MINOR)
--------------------------
1. Bug report: somehow I got TWO fullscreen activities by hitting the back button a lot.
2. Bug report: crash when creating a group and running the map for the first time (after confirming that you'll allow Floxx to "access this device's location").
3. Look at the TODOs scattered across our codebase.
