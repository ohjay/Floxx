TODO (ESSENTIAL)
----------------
1. Send email confirmations during registration. [1.5 hrs]
   - [S1] Redirect unconfirmed users to a "confirm code" entry screen when they log in
   - [S2] If the code verifies, set the user to "active" or something, and grant user portal access

// Total: 1.5 hrs
* Time estimates = (Owen's original call) x 2

TODO (BUG REPORTS / MINOR)
--------------------------
1. Bug report: crash when creating a group and running the map for the first time (after confirming that you'll allow Floxx to "access this device's location").
2. Bug report: "user is already in a meetup" just because some other person INVITED him to her meetup (?).
3. Look at the TODOs scattered across our codebase.
4. Look through (/clean up) all code. For example, turn standard output into logs.
5. Fill in the README.
6. Reword toasts for login/registration without internet access.

// Total: 2 hrs
